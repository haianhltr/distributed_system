# Frontend Testing Guide for Multi-Operation System

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing the New Operation Features

The dashboard has been updated to show and manage the new multi-operation functionality. Here's how to test it:

### 1. **Start the System**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start main server
cd main_server
python main.py

# Terminal 2: Start dashboard
cd dashboard
python main.py

# Terminal 3: Start a bot
cd bots
python bot.py
```

### 2. **Access the Dashboard**

Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3002`

### 3. **What You Should See**

#### **New Bot Information:**
- **Operation Column**: Shows each bot's assigned operation or "unassigned"
- **Color-coded Operation Badges**: 
  - Blue: sum
  - Purple: subtract  
  - Green: multiply
  - Red: divide
  - Gray: unassigned

#### **New Job Information:**
- **Operation badges** on job cards showing the operation type
- **Correct operation symbols** (e.g., `123 * 456 = ...` instead of just `+`)
- **Operation column** in the recent jobs table

### 4. **Testing Operation Features**

#### **A. Create Jobs with Different Operations:**

1. Click **"Populate Jobs"** button
2. Enter number of jobs (e.g., 5)
3. **NEW**: Enter operation type (sum, subtract, multiply, divide)
4. Click OK - jobs will be created with that operation

#### **B. Assign Bots to Operations:**

1. Find a bot in the bots table
2. Click the **"Assign"** button next to the bot
3. **NEW**: Enter an operation (sum, subtract, multiply, divide) or leave empty to unassign
4. The bot will now only claim jobs of that operation type

#### **C. Test Dynamic Assignment:**

1. Make sure you have at least one **unassigned bot** (shows "unassigned" in Operation column)
2. Create jobs with different operations
3. Watch the unassigned bot claim a job and automatically get assigned to that operation
4. Refresh the page to see the bot's new assignment

### 5. **Expected Behavior**

#### **Assigned Bots:**
- Only show jobs matching their assigned operation
- Operation badge matches their assignment
- Will wait if no jobs of their type are available

#### **Unassigned Bots:**
- Show "unassigned" in the Operation column
- Will claim any available job (oldest first)
- Automatically get assigned to the operation of the job they claim
- Operation badge updates after assignment

#### **Job Processing:**
- Jobs now show correct mathematical results based on operation
- Job cards display operation badges
- Recent jobs table shows operation types

### 6. **Quick Test Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Mixed Operations**
```
1. Create 3 sum jobs
2. Create 3 multiply jobs  
3. Assign one bot to "sum" only
4. Leave another bot unassigned
5. Watch how they claim different jobs
```

#### **Scenario 2: Dynamic Assignment**
```
1. Ensure all bots are unassigned
2. Create jobs: 2 subtract, 2 divide
3. Watch bots auto-assign to operations as they claim jobs
```

#### **Scenario 3: Operation Constraint**
```
1. Assign bot A to "multiply"
2. Create only "sum" jobs
3. Bot A should wait (not claim sum jobs)
4. Create multiply jobs
5. Bot A should immediately claim them
```

### 7. **Visual Indicators**

**Operation Badges Colors:**
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: sum operations
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: subtract operations  
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: multiply operations
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: divide operations
- âšª **Gray**: unassigned bots

**What Changed:**
- Bot table now has "Operation" column
- Job cards show operation type and correct math symbols
- "Populate Jobs" now asks for operation type
- New "Assign" button for each bot
- Job results calculated correctly per operation

### 8. **API Testing (Optional)**

You can also test the API directly:

```bash
# Get available operations
curl http://localhost:3001/operations

# Create jobs with specific operation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/jobs/populate \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin-secret-token" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"batchSize": 3, "operation": "multiply"}'

# Assign bot to operation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/bots/bot-123/assign-operation \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin-secret-token" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"operation": "subtract"}'

# Unassign bot
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/bots/bot-123/assign-operation \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin-secret-token" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"operation": null}'
```

### 9. **Troubleshooting**

**If you don't see operations:**
- Make sure the main server loaded the plugins (check server logs)
- Verify the dashboard is calling the updated API endpoints
- Refresh the browser to clear cache

**If bots aren't getting assigned:**
- Check that jobs exist for the bot's assigned operation
- Verify bots are running and sending heartbeats
- Look at server logs for claiming activity

**If operation badges don't show:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the template filters are working
- Make sure operation data is being returned by API

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Criteria

You've successfully tested the multi-operation system when you can:

âœ… See operation badges on bots and jobs  
âœ… Create jobs with different operations via the UI  
âœ… Assign bots to specific operations  
âœ… Watch unassigned bots auto-assign to operations  
âœ… See correct mathematical results for each operation type  
âœ… Verify assigned bots only claim matching jobs  

The system is working correctly when the dashboard shows rich operation information and you can manage bot assignments through the web interface!
