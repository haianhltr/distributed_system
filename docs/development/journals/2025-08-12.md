# Development Journal - 2025-08-12

## 2025-08-12 14:35 UTC
**Change:** Replaced SQLite with PostgreSQL in main_server database layer  
**Reason:** SQLite is unsuitable for production concurrency - needed ACID transactions with multiple concurrent connections  
**Next Steps:** Update all remaining database operations to use async PostgreSQL patterns

## 2025-08-12 14:42 UTC
**Change:** Updated Docker Compose to include PostgreSQL, Prometheus, and Grafana services  
**Reason:** Required production-grade database and monitoring infrastructure for scalability  
**Next Steps:** Configure Grafana dashboards and verify service health checks work properly

## 2025-08-12 14:58 UTC
**Change:** Added comprehensive test suite with 75+ test cases covering database, API, bot, and dashboard components  
**Reason:** System had zero tests - critical for production deployment and preventing regressions  
**Next Steps:** Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically on code changes

## 2025-08-12 15:15 UTC
**Change:** Implemented Prometheus metrics collection with counters, histograms, and gauges for jobs, bots, and API requests  
**Reason:** Production systems need observability - metrics essential for monitoring performance and debugging issues  
**Next Steps:** Add alerting rules for critical metrics like error rates and system downtime

## 2025-08-12 15:22 UTC
**Change:** Added structured JSON logging with contextual metadata using structlog  
**Reason:** Basic logging insufficient for production troubleshooting - needed searchable, parseable log format  
**Next Steps:** Configure log aggregation system (ELK stack) for centralized log management

## 2025-08-12 15:28 UTC
**Change:** Created Grafana dashboard with real-time visualizations for job processing rates, bot status, and system health  
**Reason:** Metrics without visualization are hard to interpret - needed operational dashboard for monitoring  
**Next Steps:** Add alerting thresholds and notification channels for critical system events

## 2025-08-12 15:35 UTC
**Change:** Added database connection pooling with asyncpg and proper async transaction handling  
**Reason:** Database connections are expensive resources - pooling required for performance and reliability  
**Next Steps:** Configure connection pool size limits based on expected load patterns

## 2025-08-12 15:42 UTC
**Change:** Created testcontainers-based test infrastructure with PostgreSQL containers and comprehensive fixtures  
**Reason:** Tests need isolated, reproducible database state - containers provide clean test environment  
**Next Steps:** Add performance benchmarks and load testing scenarios

## 2025-08-12 15:48 UTC
**Discovery:** Main server still has many SQLite-style database operations that need conversion to async PostgreSQL  
**Reason:** Partial migration could cause runtime errors when SQLite syntax doesn't work with PostgreSQL  
**Next Steps:** Convert remaining database operations (job claiming, bot management, metrics) to async patterns

## 2025-08-12 15:52 UTC
**Change:** Added missing template files (jobs.html, bots.html) for dashboard navigation  
**Reason:** Dashboard "View All" links were broken due to missing template files  
**Next Steps:** Test all dashboard navigation flows and ensure data binding works correctly
