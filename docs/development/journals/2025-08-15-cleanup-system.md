# Journal: Automated Cleanup System Implementation
**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Author**: Claude  
**Feature**: Resource Cleanup Management

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive automated cleanup system to address the accumulation of orphaned resources in the distributed job processing system. The system handles both database records (soft-deleted bots) and Docker containers, with a web-based management interface.

## Problem Statement

The system was accumulating:
1. **Database bloat**: 17 deleted bot records retained indefinitely
2. **Orphaned containers**: Stopped Docker containers not cleaned up
3. **No automated cleanup**: Manual intervention required for maintenance

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Cleanup Service (`main_server/cleanup_service.py`)

Created a dedicated cleanup service with:
- **Scheduled execution**: Runs every 6 hours (configurable)
- **Retention policies**: Configurable days to keep deleted records
- **Dry-run mode**: Preview actions before execution
- **Error handling**: Circuit breakers and retry logic
- **History tracking**: Stores last 10 cleanup runs

Key classes:
- `CleanupService`: Core cleanup logic
- `CleanupScheduler`: Manages scheduled tasks
- `CircuitBreaker`: Prevents cascade failures

### 2. Database Cleanup Strategy

Implemented soft-delete pattern with time-based cleanup:
```python
# Keep deleted records for BOT_RETENTION_DAYS (default: 7)
DELETE FROM bots 
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL 
AND deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
```

Also cleans orphaned results:
```python
DELETE FROM results 
WHERE processed_by NOT IN (SELECT id FROM bots)
```

### 3. Container Cleanup

Identifies and removes stopped containers:
- Lists all bot containers via Docker API
- Compares with active bots in database
- Removes orphaned stopped containers
- Note: Disabled when running inside container

### 4. Web Interface Integration

Added comprehensive web UI at `/cleanup`:
- **Status Dashboard**: Shows service health and configuration
- **Orphaned Resources View**: Lists deletable items
- **Action Buttons**: Dry run and execute with confirmation
- **History Table**: Displays past cleanup operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

### 5. API Endpoints

Main Server:
- `GET /admin/cleanup/status` - Service status and history
- `POST /admin/cleanup` - Trigger cleanup (with dry_run parameter)
- `POST /admin/query` - Execute safe database queries

Dashboard:
- `GET /cleanup` - Web interface
- `GET /api/cleanup/status` - Proxy to main server
- `GET /api/cleanup/orphaned` - Check orphaned resources
- `POST /api/cleanup/run` - Trigger cleanup via dashboard

## Implementation Details

### Configuration

Environment variables:
```bash
BOT_RETENTION_DAYS=7          # Days to keep deleted records
CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=6      # Hours between cleanup runs
CONTAINER_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true # Enable Docker cleanup
CLEANUP_DRY_RUN=false         # Dry run mode
```

### Safety Features

1. **Dry Run Mode**: Test cleanup without executing
2. **Confirmation Dialog**: Requires user confirmation for execution
3. **Transaction Safety**: All database operations are atomic
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of cleanup operations
5. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Monitoring

Added cleanup widget to main dashboard showing:
- Service running status
- Current retention policy
- Next scheduled run
- Quick link to management page

## Testing Results

Successfully tested all components:
1. ✅ API endpoints functional
2. ✅ Database cleanup working (deleted 1 bot, 17 orphaned results)
3. ✅ Web interface accessible and responsive
4. ✅ History tracking operational
5. ⚠️ Container cleanup disabled in Docker environment (expected)

## Best Practices Documented

Created `CLEANUP_BEST_PRACTICES.md` covering:
- Gradual rollout strategy
- Retention tuning guidelines
- Performance considerations
- Operational procedures
- Monitoring and KPIs

## Future Enhancements

1. **Prometheus Metrics**: Export cleanup statistics
2. **Intelligent Scheduling**: Load-based cleanup timing
3. **Advanced Policies**: Tag-based retention rules
4. **Grafana Dashboard**: Visualize cleanup trends
5. **Email Alerts**: Notify on cleanup failures

## Lessons Learned

1. **Container Context**: Docker operations don't work inside containers
2. **Date Handling**: PostgreSQL interval arithmetic simplifies retention queries
3. **User Safety**: Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental data loss
4. **History Value**: Tracking cleanup history aids debugging
5. **Configuration Flexibility**: Environment variables enable easy deployment

## Commands for Operators

Monitor cleanup:
```bash
./scripts/monitor-cleanup.sh
```

Manual cleanup:
```bash
# Dry run
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/admin/cleanup?dry_run=true \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin-secret-token"

# Execute
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/admin/cleanup?dry_run=false \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin-secret-token"
```

## Impact

The cleanup system ensures long-term sustainability by:
- Preventing unbounded database growth
- Reducing storage costs
- Improving query performance
- Maintaining system hygiene
- Providing operational visibility

This implementation demonstrates production-grade resource management suitable for enterprise distributed systems.
